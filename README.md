# AI Password Predictor

This project aims to develop an AI-powered password predictor that learns from user interactions and feedback to generate personalized and secure passwords.

## Components

1. **data_collection.py**: Collects user interactions, including input phrases and generated passphrases, and stores them in log files.
2. **machine_learning_model.py**: Trains a machine learning model on collected user interaction data to predict passphrases.
3. **feedback_loop.py**: Gathers user feedback on generated passphrases and stores it in log files.
4. **adaptive_codebase.py**: Dynamically adjusts the codebase based on insights from the machine learning model.
5. **continuous_improvement.py**: Implements processes for continuous evaluation of the model's performance and updates its algorithms accordingly.
6. **privacy_security.py**: Implements robust privacy and security measures to protect user data and maintain trust in the system.

## Usage

1. Run `data_collection.py` to collect user interactions.
2. Train the machine learning model using `machine_learning_model.py`.
3. Gather user feedback on generated passphrases using `feedback_loop.py`.
4. Use `adaptive_codebase.py` to dynamically adjust the codebase based on model insights.
5. Implement continuous improvement processes using `continuous_improvement.py`.
6. Ensure privacy and security measures using `privacy_security.py`.
